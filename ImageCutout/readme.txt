A simple tool for creating image cutout.

Run by command:
python image_cutout.py --img_path <path-to-image-folder> --out_path <path-to-output-folder> --mask_size <size>

If no output path is specified, it will go into the img_path folder. The new file names will be appended with "_cutout" at the end.
